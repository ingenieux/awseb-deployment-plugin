  How to set the version label? For instance, for "${GIT_COMMIT}-${BUILD_TAG}", and with "Key Prefix" set to 
  "myapp/builds/myapp-prod-env/", the S3 Object Key is set to 
  myapp/builds/myapp-prod-env/4b5f7669b3376a1ce504bf7ef8bf7aeee9d21746-myjob-41.zip and 
  the version Label will be 4b5f7669b3376a1ce504bf7ef8bf7aeee9d21746-myjob-41 on AWS EB Application Versions
